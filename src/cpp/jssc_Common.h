 * timeoutDeadline is a point on the time scale provided by System.nanoTime(), but in micro-
 * seconds.  It may be negative, 0, or positive.
 * pollPeriodMillis is how often the thread should check its interrupted status, or 0 if
 * the thread should never check.
 * deadlineValid is an indicator to show if timeoutDeadline is valid or not, since any possible
 * value for timeoutDeadline would be acceptable.  Set deadlineValid to 0 to indicate timeoutDeadline
 * should be ignored; set to non-zero otherwise.
 * Note that setting the deadlineValid parameter to 0 and the pollPeriodMillis to 0 is an invalid
 * combination, since there is no way to set up the time struct to block forever; this has to be 
 * done through the select call itself.  In this case the function returns 1 to indicate error.
 * Returns 1 on error (and thus the time* is undefined), returns 0 if the time struct has been 
 * filled with the next unblock timeout for select().
